# MIA-Project

For the datasets:
There are two folders containing the datasets we need, for now we only use Adult, Broward and Hosppital datasets:
1) in the "datasets" folder, we have the data without one hot transfer. This data can be used to train models like Decision tree or random forest.
2) In the "One_hot" folder we have data that is preprocessed with one hot transfer. This one is needed for all the neural networks
